Quote 'Holics

This project started as a collection of quotes for and by friends. Often quote engines only allow those quotes from a famous person but some of the best quotes can be from everyday people around you.

The app starts out on the search page. Here people can search our database for quotes, add quotes, edit quote, and delete quotes. They are also able to move to the Author Page.

The Author Page is a list of Authors that our quote database features. Here users can add quotes, edit quotes, and delete quotes.


This project uses Javascript both client and server side, html, css, mocha, chai, MongoDB, and node/express to work.
